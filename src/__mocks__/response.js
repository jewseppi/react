      'Often overlooked as a songwriter, despite penning The Beatles\' standards "Something" and "Here Comes the Sun", and being the first of the four to release solo material, George Harrison embraced fame reluctantly, retiring from public life after the assassination of John Lennon. Launching a spectacular late-1980s comeback with The Traveling Wilburys, he returned as a household name for a new generation with the Anthology projects and 2000\'s best-selling <i>1</i> album.<br />This abridged version of <i>George Harrison</i> chronicles the life of  "the quiet one" right up to his recent unsuccessful battle with cancer.',

      "This special <i>To The Best of Our Knowledge</i> series contains five programs:<br /><b>In the Beginning</b><br />Where do we come from? Fair question. Religious scholar Stephen Mitchell says the answer lies in humanity's different creation myths. Theoretical physicist Michio Kaku says we're the reverb of a Big Bang from another universe. And, midwifery guru Ina May Gaskin gets down to where each one of us really comes from - mom.<br /><br /><b>Why Bother?</b><br />Catholic-nun-turned-unbeliever Karen Armstrong describes her path back to God. Cinema Nirvana: enlightenment lessons from Hollywood. Also, Parker Palmer on how to keep going when life stops making sense. And, that good old existentialist, Charlie Brown.<br /><br /><b>Are We Having Fun Yet?</b><br />At nearly 70, one high school English teacher discovers the joys of sex. Poet Billy Collins stops to smell the roses while our host, Jim Fleming, goes to Paris for a sumptuous chocolate tour. And, to the woods we go, playing jazz for the birds.<br /><br /><b>Regrets</b><br />Pete Best has a few... He had Ringo's job just months before the Beatles' first hit \"Love Me Do\" came out. Also, world-renowned concert pianist Leon Fleisher reflects on the disease that destroyed his right hand. And, one man sets out to apologize to the descendants of his family's slaves.<br /><br /><b>The End</b><br />What happens when we die? Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen says much more than you think. Novelist Jim Crace says nothing, nothing at all. Also, Amy Tan's story of the murder that shaped her life as a writer. And, whistle a tune at the Grim Reaper with Monty Python's Eric Idle.",

      "When the most successful pop group in the world, The Beatles, disbanded in 1970, its four members went off to spearhead radically different projects, and none was more successful than Paul McCartney.

      'Beatles is the ultimate coming-of-age story. Four teenage boys are growing up in Oslo at the time when Beatle - mania hits Norway. Kim, Gunnar, Ola and Seb each take on one of the Fab Fours names, and they plan to start their own outfit, The Snafus. Like many teenage dreams, this one never comes to fruition, but the need to save up for instruments becomes the drive behind much of what they do as they blunder through their formative years, struggling with archaic textbooks and ancient teachers, discovering girls, being beaten up by rival gangs, experimenting with alcohol, and finding their footing as activists."Beatles" bygger p√• Lars Saabye Christensens fantastiske roman om Kim, Seb, Ola og Gunnar.',
